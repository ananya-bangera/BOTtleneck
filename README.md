## 📈Progress
For Mobile Application:
- Introduction Screens
- Authentication
- Chatbot Feature  

First, the user needs to authenticate himself to the system via his/her email. Then he would be taken to the chatbot feature tab. Here the mobile application is an implementation of a hospital chatbot. This chatbot assists the user to diagnose the disease. Now the users are being asked about the symptoms of a specific disease. The user response in each case is being stored. After finishing the set of questions, the chatbot would try to find the matching symptoms with the available diseases in the database and communicate the same to the user. Then finally the user will be asked to enter a preferable time. The bot would provide the names and availability of the physicians according to the user's suitable time period.
